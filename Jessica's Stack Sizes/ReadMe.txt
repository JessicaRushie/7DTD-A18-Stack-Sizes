A MOD to increase "Most" stack sizes.

Very usefull to builders as all building blocks are also included.

Some items are increased to 25000 and others to only 5000, This is what i have found to be the "Safe" limit.
IF they are any higher then this you start to get "binary stack overflows" where the number is just too big for the game to handle.

This is not cheating at all IMO. This is because you can carry 500 1 Metre Square blocks in each bag/belt slot but only a few bandages in another. This serves only to create a "False Difficulty", by TFP, but it does not manage this at all, all it does is make inventory management boring as hell.

There is no way to make the stack sizes logical and still keep the game fun and i HATE inventory management so this is the result.

Hope you like it.
